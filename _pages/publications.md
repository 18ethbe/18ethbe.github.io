My <a href="../files/MRP_NBenjamin_Final.pdf">major research paper</a> (Western University's rough equivalent of a thesis for one-year Master's programs) studied six theories of L3 transfer, using the gender congruency effect and English/French L1/L2 mirror image groups learning Spanish. I was able to observe a gender congruency effect, especially for L1 French participants, indicating that linguistic transfer occurs at least from the L1. However, due to a limited participant pool, it was difficult to draw any further major conclusions from my data, and additional L2 transfer can't be ruled out. Task effects also played a big roleâ€“ orthographic cues and agreement contexts in one of my tasks meant that participants did not access gender information at a cognitively-deep level, instead only reading gendered affixes to determine agreement.

The [https://www.thirdlanguageacquisition.com/](research team) I belong to at the University of Western Ontario also has an upcoming publication in Studies in Hispanic and Lusophone Linguistics! We looked at gender production and processing in Russian-English-Spanish trilinguals who vary in their proficiency in Spanish and in how they learned Spanish- instructed learning (i.e., classroom) or naturalistic learning (i.e., immersion, living in a Spanish-speaking country, etc.). Naturalistic beginning learners outperformed instructed beginning learners, but this advantage did not appear at higher levels.
