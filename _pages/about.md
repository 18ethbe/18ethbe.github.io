<p>I am a student in the University of Western Ontario's Ph.D. program in Hispanic studies, in the Hispanic linguistics stream. My interests include psycholinguistics, morphology (especially grammatical gender), multilingualism, and acquisition. I am a proud Pennsylvanian, born in beautiful Central Pennsylvania, and I spent my first two years of my undergraduate degree studying world languages education at the wonderful Penn State University, transferring to the University of British Columbia, Okanagan, in Kelowna, BC, Canada in 2020. I earned a Bachelor of Arts, specializing in Spanish, political science, and philosophy, in June 2022.</p>

<p>I will be joining the University of Zaragoza in June 2024 for a doctoral research contract on a project that examines multimodal language in three domains of lexical motivation (iconic: ideophones, conceptual: intentionality, and grammatical: gender). My master's thesis investigated the cross-linguistic gender congruency effect in English-French and French-English bilingual learners of Spanish, aiming to identify the roles of language typology and order of acquisition in third language acquisition and transfer. I have worked on research teams investigating the emergence and use of Spanish novel non-binary gender forms on social media, L3 acquistion of typologically-distinct languages, and changes in incremental sentence processing (prediction; using the visual world eye-tracking paradigm) as vocabulary size grows. I've dabbled in phonology (working with the Viby-i in Swedish), syntax (defending a notional view of syntactic imposters), and inclusive language in Spanish.</p>

<p>I am a native speaker of English and fluent in Spanish, with just a touch of American Sign Language and French in my repertoireâ€“ Hebrew and Swedish, you're up next!</p>
  
<p>When I am not in class or teaching, you can probably find me crocheting, cross stitching, or editing my [literary magazine]((https://transientsmagazine.weebly.com/).</p>
